abstract: This present study suggests a method to calculate the SO<sub>2</sub> flow rate from a source area to receptor areas on a regional scale using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) SO<sub>2</sub> products, surface in situ SO<sub>2</sub> data, and the hybrid single particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. The method was implemented to calculate the SO<sub>2</sub> flow rate from continental Asia to northeast Asia and the Northwest Pacific Ocean. For the high SO<sub>2</sub> events when SO<sub>2</sub> was transported from continental Asia to Japan via the Korean Peninsula on 22–24 December 2006, the long-range transported SO<sub>2</sub> flow rates were 14.0 (21.0) Mg h<sup>-1</sup>  OMI gird<sup>-1</sup> at Gangneung (Seoul) in Korea and 4.2 (5.3) Mg h<sup>-1</sup> OMI gird<sup>-1</sup> at Hiroshima (Kumamoto) in Japan. For the long-range transport of SO<sub>2</sub> from continental Asia to the Northwest Pacific Ocean on 6–7 October 2008 (9–11 October 2006), the flow rates were 16.1 (16.2) Mg h<sup>-1</sup> OMI gird<sup>-1</sup> at Hokkaido, Japan (Vladivostok, Russia) and 5.6 (16.7) Mg h<sup>-1</sup> OMI gird<sup>-1</sup> at the Aleutian Islands, Northwest Pacific Ocean (Bering Sea). The mean rates of decrease in the SO<suㅠ>2</suㅠ> flow rate per 1000 km were also calculated between continental Asia and the receptor areas. Uncertainties in the flow rate estimates were also assessed and discussed.
