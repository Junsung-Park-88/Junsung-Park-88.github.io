My name is Junsung. I have the following qualities:

I am a researcher specializing in retrieving and analyzing atmospheric pollutants using satellite data. I hold a Ph.D. in Engineering, focusing primarily on satellite-based monitoring of air pollutants such as NO₂, SO₂, and O₃.

My research extends beyond satellite data, encompassing quantitative analyses of long-range transported sulfur dioxide (SO₂) using satellite observations, as well as sensitivity assessments of formaldehyde (HCHO) retrievals from ground-based Pandora instruments. Additionally, I have extensive experience integrating in-situ observational data with ground-based remote sensing instruments such as MAX-DOAS and Pandora to validate satellite retrievals and assess regional air quality trends.

This approach has enabled me to bridge satellite-based monitoring with ground-based observational networks, providing a more comprehensive understanding of atmospheric pollution dynamics.

During my doctoral studies, I was affiliated with the research group of Prof. Hanlim Lee at Pukyong National University, where I developed and validated the NO₂ retrieval algorithm for the GEMS sensor. This algorithm was part of a project led by Prof. Jhoon Kim at Yonsei University, aimed at producing hourly air quality observations across Asia using Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), a first geostationary environmental monitoring sensor.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics / Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA) and am working on developing the TEMPO total ozone and ozone profile retrieval algorithms. In addition, I am contributing to a study led by Dr. Masoud Ghahremanloo to estimate surface ozone concentrations over CONUS (Continental United States) using Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) ozone products. Additionally, I am working as a Co-I with Dr Xiong Liu at CfA, focusing on the validation of ozone profile products retrieved from the GEMS collaboration with Prof. Jhoon Kim’s group and the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BIRA-IASB).

My work emphasizes the integration of satellite observations with ground-based measurements to enhance the accuracy of air quality monitoring and to provide insights into regional and transboundary pollution transport.

Feel free to reach out to discuss potential research collaborations or data analysis opportunities.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
